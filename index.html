<!--About me-->
			<h2 id="about me"> About Me</h2>
<!--paragraphfont is-->			<p class="paragraphfont">Hello. My name is Kevin, and this is <em>my very beautiful<br> 
<!--used for all paragraphs-->			blog</em> in which I have no idea whether it will work or not. I'm just beginning to learn how to code properly <br>
					and i'm trying to remember the basics I started teaching myself how to code because I feel like it would help me learn <br>
					a little bit of coding before I start to learn more code in school. Now, I feel like this isn't going to help too much. <br>
					However, it may still help me in the future if I ever decide to create a website.<br>
					 After a few hours praticing and messing around with code, I feel <br>
					moderately interested in coding. This picture I would <br>
					say is a good representation of myself.</p>

<!--interests-->		<h2 id="interests"> Interests</h2>
					<p class="paragraphfont"><em><strong>Life has given all of us many chances to do what we love to do.</strong></em> <br>
					At that time, we may not even know it yet. However, once time progresses, you finally understand what you are passionate about.<br>
					My personal interests are simply sports in general. All sports seem interesting and they are all enjoyable.<br>
					Specific sports include soccer, Canadian football, swimming, basketball, as well as <br>
					many other activities that may possibly pass as professional sports</p>
<!--reasoning-->		<h2 id="reason">Reasoning</h2>
					<p class="paragraphfont">The reasoning to why I decided to start this blog, is because of <strong>khan academy.</strong><br>
					I always wanted to make a website, and I feel that a blog would be a good start to learning the basics of creating a website.<br>
					This blog has allowed me to gain further knowledge towards coding and the language. <br>
					It allows me to further my knowledge, as well as experiment with different commands and see how they work. </p>
<!--MoreAboutMe--> 	<h2 id="more about me">More About Me</h2> 
					<p class="paragraphfont">Some extra stuff about me, <em>if you are willing to read</em>, is that I spend a lot of time biking out around the area.<br>
					Every time I go on a ride, I ride for at least 3 hours and depending on my riding companion.<br>
					These rides allow me to do many things. Things that I will list below. </p>
				<ul id="unordered"> 
					<li>Allows me to get away from my house and my computer.</li>
					<li>Gives me a break and allows me to clear my mind.</li>
					<li>Lets me spend some time with friends which is much better than sitting alone, infront of a computer.</li>
					<li>Is a great workout.</li>
				</ul>
